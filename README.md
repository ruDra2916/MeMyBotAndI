# ü§ñ MeMyBotAndI ‚Äì Your Personal AI Assistant

Modern professionals often struggle to present their profiles interactively on the web. Static resumes and text-heavy portfolio sites fail to create engagement. With the rise of conversational AI, we‚Äôve built an intelligent assistant that can *represent Dhanush Rudra* in real-time conversations‚Äîanswering questions about his career, skills, and projects just like he would.

*MeMyBotAndI* is a personalized chatbot powered by OpenAI, integrated with Gradio‚Äôs UI, that reads and responds to queries using Dhanush's actual resume and professional summary. It records leads, logs unknown questions, and provides a smooth, engaging experience for anyone exploring his work.

## üß™ Methodology

The system is designed to act as a digital ambassador for Dhanush Rudra. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Data Extraction**  
   - Loads a PDF resume using `pypdf`  
   - Parses a summary file containing high-level insights

2. **Conversational Logic**  
   - All messages are passed through OpenAI‚Äôs `gpt-4o-mini` with tool-use enabled  
   - The model is initialized with both resume and summary context  

3. **Tool Usage**  
   - If the user provides contact info, it‚Äôs logged via `record_user_details()`  
   - If the bot doesn't know the answer, the question is logged using `record_unknown_question()`

4. **User Interface**  
   - Built with Gradio Blocks  
   - Features a 25% left sidebar for branding, 75% right chat window  
   - Uses a dark mode theme with gold highlight styling

5. **Notifications**  
   - Push notifications are sent to the developer in real time using [Pushover API](https://pushover.net/)
